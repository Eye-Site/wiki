                <p>
                    Poppy, a 28-year-old travel content creator, struggles with low vision and color blindness when accessing visually-heavy websites. Zooming in to 200% helps her read text, but she often has difficulty interpreting images with text. While searching for a travel gadget on Amazon, she uses EyeSite to convert small text from product images into a readable format, allowing her to make informed purchases.

                <p>
                    At EyeSite, we’re all about making the web a friendlier place for everyone. Along with our current OCR capabilities, we’re excited to roll out some new features that will enhance your browsing experience:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Improved Link Text Correction:</dt>
                    <dd>Our tool will automatically identify vague link texts and provide clear, descriptive alternatives. This ensures that every link gives users the context they need, especially for those using screen readers.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Optimized Heading Structure:</dt>
                    <dd>We’ll analyze and adjust heading levels for a logical flow, making navigation easier and more intuitive for assistive technologies.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Enhanced Table Accessibility:</dt>
                    <dd>We’re introducing checks for tables to make sure they show data relationships. Plus, we’ll remove layout tables that don’t add meaningful content.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Descriptive Language for Sensory Characteristics:</dt>
                    <dd>We’ll transform sensory descriptions into clearer, more accessible language. For example, instead of saying "the green button on the right," we’ll provide informative labels that give context without relying on color or position.</dd>
                </dl>
                    
                <p>
                    Stay tuned for these enhancements as we continue to empower users and promote a more inclusive web experience for everyone!
